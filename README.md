## Overview

This application is a simple React-based login demo that illustrates basic state management and conditional rendering. It consists of two main components:

- **App Component:**  
  The main component manages the user state using React’s `useState` hook. It conditionally renders either a welcome message with a logout button when a user is logged in or displays the login form when no user is authenticated. citeturn0file0

- **Login Component:**  
  This component provides a basic login form where users can enter their username and password. It includes form validation to ensure both fields are filled and simulates authentication by checking against hardcoded credentials (`admin`/`password`). On successful authentication, it triggers a callback to update the user state in the App component. citeturn0file1

## Features

- **State Management:**  
  Uses React's `useState` hook to manage authentication state.

- **Conditional Rendering:**  
  Dynamically displays the login form or a welcome message based on the user's authentication status.

- **Form Validation:**  
  Provides basic validation to ensure that users provide both a username and a password before attempting to log in.

- **Simple Authentication:**  
  Demonstrates a basic approach to user authentication with hardcoded credentials (ideal for demonstration purposes).


This app serves as a practical example for beginners looking to understand core React concepts such as state, props, and conditional rendering. You can expand or modify it as needed for more complex applications.# LogIn_Vercel
